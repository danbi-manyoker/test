##### Tutorial: Voyant
1. Upon first using Voyant, everything was relatively straight forward and intuitive. Using the data visualizations felt easy and incredibly useful for interpreting data in a variety of different ways dependent on which graphical representations best fit your research.

2. After reading into embedding an visual from Voyant into an HTML, I came across an issue with making it work. It ended up being an issue with the HTML not being able to be viewed within the MD preview within the text editor I use.

##### Tutorial: Point Map with Google Maps
1. I ended up choosing a variety of different historical and museological sites across Ottawa and it's surrounding area.

2. I had to manually adjust certain locations on my Google maps because of certain addresses not being exact representations of the locations' geographical positioning on a map.

3. I chose the sites based roughly on the attendance that they receive, and thereby how popular they are.

##### Tutorial: AntConc
1. Initially, I was confused in regards to operating AntConc due to the certain inconsistencies between the tutorial image and what I was seeing. I eventually just proceeded with the tutorial since the problem seemed negligible. The problem being within the image shown, the total number of text files was shown to be 400, while for me it was around 3080, making certain features for AntConc such as the Keyword List to take several minutes to load.


2. As opposed to Voyant, AntConc allowed for a different kind of pattern recognition in regard to the data used. Whereas Voyant consists of mainly graphics and plots to visualize data, AntConc seems to be more useful for find patterns relating to grammar and recurring phrases within a given corpus.

3. Another thing I was confused about was the grammar of some of the text files. Much of the grammar was unintelligible for me and led me to thinking about whether or not it was an error of translating the original collection of chapbooks to digital or whether the English used in these documents was considerably different. Though this is unlikely as the Tutorial stated that these chapbooks were from most the 18th and 19th century, when English had already experienced the majority of it's major linguistic transformations.

##### HUGE REVELATION: STUPID INTERACTION
So it turns out that images created via snipping tool on my PC are not able to be shown on GitHub for some strange reason. From the last part I tried solving the issue of images not appearing in the MD file within GitHub and figured out that all of those pictures were taken by the snipping tool and I tried recreating the problem and turns out that that was it all along. Super stupid. I also did not find a way to take screenshots of my work in a way that circumvented the problem in an efficient manner.
